# Basic Profit and Loss Calculations

## Core Formulas

- **Profit (P)** = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP)
- **Loss (L)** = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP)
- **Profit Percentage** = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100
- **Loss Percentage** = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100
- **Selling Price (SP)** = CP + Profit = CP × (1 + P%)
- **Selling Price (SP)** = CP - Loss = CP × (1 - L%)
- **Cost Price (CP)** = SP / (1 + P%) = SP × 100/(100 + P%)
- **Cost Price (CP)** = SP / (1 - L%) = SP × 100/(100 - L%)

## Question Pattern 1: Basic Profit/Loss Percentage

**Pattern:** Given CP and SP, find profit/loss percentage

**Examples:**
1. If the selling price of an article is 7/6 of its cost price, then what is the profit percentage in the transaction?
   - Solution: SP = (7/6)CP, so profit = SP - CP = (7/6)CP - CP = CP/6
   - Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100 = (CP/6)/CP × 100 = 16.67%

2. If the cost price of 28 oranges is equal to selling price of 24 oranges, then the profit percentage is:
   - Solution: SP of 24 oranges = CP of 28 oranges
   - SP of 1 orange = CP of 28/24 oranges = (28/24)CP = (7/6)CP
   - So profit% = [(7/6)CP - CP]/CP × 100 = 16.67%

## Question Pattern 2: Finding CP or SP from Profit/Loss Percentage

**Pattern:** Given profit/loss percentage and one of CP or SP, find the other

**Examples:**
1. The cost price of 30 articles is the same as the selling price of x articles. If the profit is 20%, then the value of x is:
   - Solution: If profit is 20%, then SP = 1.2CP
   - CP of 30 articles = SP of x articles
   - 30CP = x × 1.2CP
   - x = 30/1.2 = 25

2. By selling 20 mangoes a person recovers price of 25 mangoes. Then profit percentage is:
   - Solution: SP of 20 mangoes = CP of 25 mangoes
   - SP of 1 mango = CP of 25/20 = 1.25CP
   - Profit% = (1.25CP - CP)/CP × 100 = 25%

## Question Pattern 3: Relationship Between Profit/Loss Percentage and Ratio of SP to CP

**Pattern:** Given relationship between SP and CP in terms of ratios, find profit/loss percentage

**Examples:**
1. The selling price of a chair is 46/25 times its cost price. What is the gain percentage in the transaction?
   - Solution: SP = (46/25)CP
   - Profit = SP - CP = (46/25)CP - CP = (21/25)CP
   - Profit% = [(21/25)CP/CP] × 100 = 84%

2. By selling 80 notebooks, Amrita loses an amount equal to the selling price of 10 notebooks. What is her loss per cent?
   - Solution: Loss = SP of 10 notebooks
   - CP of 80 notebooks - SP of 80 notebooks = SP of 10 notebooks
   - CP of 80 - SP of 80 = SP of 10
   - CP of 80 = SP of 90
   - CP of 1 = SP of 90/80 = (9/8)SP
   - Loss% = (CP - SP)/CP × 100 = [((9/8)SP - SP)/((9/8)SP)] × 100 = 11.11%

## Tips for Quick Solving

1. **Ratio Method**: If SP:CP = a:b, then:
   - Profit% = [(a-b)/b] × 100
   - Loss% = [(b-a)/b] × 100

2. **Article Method**: If CP of x articles = SP of y articles, then:
   - If x > y: Loss% = [(x-y)/x] × 100
   - If x < y: Profit% = [(y-x)/x] × 100

3. **Quick Conversions**:
   - To find CP when SP and P% are given: CP = SP × 100/(100 + P%)
   - To find CP when SP and L% are given: CP = SP × 100/(100 - L%)
   - To find SP when CP and P% are given: SP = CP × (100 + P%)/100
   - To find SP when CP and L% are given: SP = CP × (100 - L%)/100
