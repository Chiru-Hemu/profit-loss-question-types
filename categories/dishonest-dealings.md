# Dishonest Dealings (False Weights)

This category involves questions where a seller uses incorrect weights to gain additional profit.

## Core Formulas

- If a seller uses a weight of **x grams** instead of **1000 grams (1 kg)**, the actual profit percentage is:
  - Actual Profit% = [(1000/x) × (1 + P%) - 1] × 100
  
- If a seller claims to sell at **no profit/loss** but uses a false weight of **x grams** instead of **1000 grams**:
  - Actual Profit% = [(1000/x) - 1] × 100
  
- If a seller claims to sell at **L% loss** but uses a false weight of **x grams** instead of **1000 grams**:
  - Actual Profit% = [(1000/x) × (1 - L%) - 1] × 100

## Question Pattern 1: False Weight with Claimed Profit/Loss

**Pattern:** A dishonest dealer sells at a stated profit/loss but uses false weights

**Examples:**
1. A shopkeeper sells an item at a profit of 15% and uses a weight which is 20% less. Find his actual profit percentage.
   - Solution: Stated profit = 15%, Weight used = 800g (20% less than 1kg)
   - Actual Profit% = [(1000/800) × (1 + 0.15) - 1] × 100
   - = [(1.25 × 1.15) - 1] × 100 = 43.75%

2. A dishonest dealer sells articles at 15% loss on cost price but uses the weight of 20g instead of 25g. What is his profit or loss percentage?
   - Solution: Stated loss = 15%, Ratio of actual to claimed weight = 25/20
   - Actual Profit% = [(25/20) × (1 - 0.15) - 1] × 100
   - = [(1.25 × 0.85) - 1] × 100 = 6.25%

## Question Pattern 2: Finding the False Weight

**Pattern:** Given the profit percentages, find the false weight used

**Examples:**
1. A dishonest dealer claimed he sells rice at a loss of 5%, but he used faulty weights and weighs 20% less rice. Calculate his overall loss or gain%.
   - Solution: Stated loss = 5%, Weight used = 80% of 1kg = 800g
   - Actual Profit% = [(1000/800) × (1 - 0.05) - 1] × 100
   - = [(1.25 × 0.95) - 1] × 100 = 18.75%

2. Aman used a false weight of 'k' grams instead of 1 kg and sold 40 kg sugar for the cost price of 48 kg sugar. If his overall gain percent is 50%, what is the value of k?
   - Solution: Let's work backwards
   - If he sold 40kg at CP of 48kg, true profit% = [(48/40) - 1] × 100 = 20%
   - But actual profit% = 50%
   - So (1000/k) × 1.2 - 1 = 0.5
   - 1000/k × 1.2 = 1.5
   - 1000/k = 1.5/1.2 = 1.25
   - k = 1000/1.25 = 800g

## Question Pattern 3: Multiple Transactions with False Weights

**Pattern:** Dealer uses different weights for buying and selling

**Examples:**
1. In a defective balance the weight of left edge is 100g more than its right edge. A shopkeeper while purchasing keeps weights on left edge and while selling keeps weights on right edge. He only uses weight of 1 kg. If he sells the things on marked price, then his profit is:
   - Solution: When buying, 1kg weight on left shows 900g on scale
   - When selling, 1kg weight on right shows 1100g on scale
   - So for every 900g purchased, he sells 1100g
   - Profit% = [(1100/900) - 1] × 100 = 22.22%

2. A merchant uses a 110cm tape instead of 1m while buying the clothes, while selling the clothes he used 90cm tape instead of 1m and then he offers a discount of 10%. Find Profit or loss%?
   - Solution: When buying, pays for 100cm but gets 110cm
   - When selling, charges for 100cm but gives 90cm
   - Discount = 10%
   - Actual Profit% = [(110/90) × (1 - 0.1) - 1] × 100
   - = [(1.22 × 0.9) - 1] × 100 = 10%

## Question Pattern 4: Combination of False Weight and Markup/Discount

**Pattern:** Seller uses a combination of false weights, markup and discounts

**Examples:**
1. A shopkeeper markup 20% on his articles, uses faulty weight 450gm in place of 500gm and gives discount of 40%. Find the profit% or loss%?
   - Solution: Markup = 20%, Weight ratio = 500/450, Discount = 40%
   - Actual Profit% = [(500/450) × (1.2 × 0.6) - 1] × 100
   - = [(1.11 × 0.72) - 1] × 100 = -20%

2. A dishonest dealer is selling sugar at 40 per kg and pretending that he is selling it at a loss of 5 per kg but he actually gives 800g instead of 1 kg, using a faculty weight. What is his actual profit or loss percent?
   - If CP = 45 per kg (since claimed loss is 5 per kg) and SP = 40 per kg
   - Claimed loss% = (45-40)/45 × 100 = 11.11%
   - Actual Profit% = [(1000/800) × (1 - 0.1111) - 1] × 100
   - = [(1.25 × 0.8889) - 1] × 100 = 11.11%

## Tips for Quick Solving

1. **Key Insight**: The actual quantity sold is (Stated Weight × Actual Weight / Claimed Weight)

2. **Quick Formula**: For a simple case where selling at CP with false weight of x grams instead of 1000g:
   - Profit% = [(1000/x) - 1] × 100

3. **Combined Effects**: When both false weights and stated profit/loss are involved:
   - First calculate the effect of the stated profit/loss
   - Then apply the weight ratio adjustment
